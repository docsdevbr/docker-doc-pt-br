For more information on Docker subscriptions, see [Docker subscription overview](_index.md).

### Can I transfer my subscription from one user or organization account to another?

Subscriptions are non-transferable.

### Can I pause or delay my Docker subscription?

You can't pause or delay a subscription, but you can [downgrade](change.md). If a subscription invoice hasn't been paid on the due date, there's a 15 day grace period, including the due date.

### Does Docker offer academic pricing?

Contact the [Docker Sales Team](https://www.docker.com/company/contact).

### What ways can I contribute to Docker content?

Docker offers two programs:
- [Docker-Sponsored Open Source Program (DSOS)](../docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dsos-program.md)
- [Docker Verified Publisher (DVP)](../docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dvp-program.md)

You can also join the [Developer Preview Program](https://www.docker.com/community/get-involved/developer-preview/) or sign up for early access programs for specific products to participate in research and try out new features.
