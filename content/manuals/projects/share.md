Docker Projects makes it easy for teams to share, manage, and collaborate on containerized applications.

Collaboration is managed by associating a project with a Docker organization, and leveraging cloud-stored configurations. This allows team members to easily access and work on the same project without needing extensive manual setup.

Once a project is associated with an organization, other team members can access it by:

1. Signing into Docker Desktop and navigating to **Projects**.

2. Selecting the correct organization tab.

3. Selecting the project from the list of shared projects.

4. Cloning the project into a local destination.
