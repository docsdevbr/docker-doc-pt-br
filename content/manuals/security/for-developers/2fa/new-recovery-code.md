If you have lost your two-factor authentication recovery code and still have
access to your Docker Hub account, you can generate a new recovery code.

1. Sign in to your [Docker account](https://app.docker.com/login).
2. Select your avatar and then from the drop-down menu, select **Account settings**.
3. Select **2FA**.
4. Enter your password, then select **Confirm**.
5. Select **Generate new code**.

This generates a new code. Select the visibility icon to view the code. Remember to save your recovery code
and store it somewhere safe.
