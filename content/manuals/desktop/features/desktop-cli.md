{{< summary-bar feature_name="Docker Desktop CLI" >}}

The Docker Desktop CLI lets you perform key operations such as starting, stopping, restarting, and updating Docker Desktop directly from the command line.

The Docker Desktop CLI provides:

- Simplified automation for local development: Execute Docker Desktop operations more efficiently in scripts and tests. 
- An improved developer experience: Restart, quit, or reset Docker Desktop from the command line, reducing dependency on the Docker Desktop Dashboard and improving flexibility and efficiency.

## Usage

```console
docker desktop COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```
