Docker Desktop Enterprise (DDE) has been deprecated and is no longer in active development. Please use [Docker Desktop](../_index.md) Community instead.

If you are an existing DDE customer, use our [Support form](https://hub.docker.com/support/desktop/) to request a transition to one of our new [subscription plans](https://www.docker.com/pricing).

If you are looking to deploy Docker Desktop at scale, contact us on [pricingquestions@docker.com](mailto:pricingquestions@docker.com).
