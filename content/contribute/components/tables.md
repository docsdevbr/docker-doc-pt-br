| **Bold** or _italic_ within a table cell. Next cell is empty on purpose. |                                                               |

| Read                                                                     | Pull                                                          |

## Markdown

### Basic table

```md
| Permission level                                                         | Access                                                        |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bold** or _italic_ within a table cell. Next cell is empty on purpose. |                                                               |
|                                                                          | Previous cell is empty. A `--flag` in mono text.              |
| Read                                                                     | Pull                                                          |
| Read/Write                                                               | Pull, push                                                    |
| Admin                                                                    | All of the above, plus update description, create, and delete |
```

The alignment of the cells in the source doesn't really matter. The ending pipe
character is optional (unless the last cell is supposed to be empty).
