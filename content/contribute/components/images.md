## Example

- A small image: ![a small image](/assets/images/footer_moby_icon.png)

- Large images occupy the full width of the reading column by default:

  ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png)

- Image size can be set using query parameters: `?h=<height>&w=<width>`

  ![a pretty wide image](/assets/images/banner_image_24512.png?w=100&h=50)

- Image with a border, also set with a query parameter: `?border=true`

  ![a small image](/assets/images/footer_moby_icon.png?border=true)
