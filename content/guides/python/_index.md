The Python language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a Python application using Docker. In this guide, youâ€™ll learn how to:

- Containerize and run a Python application
- Set up a local environment to develop a Python application using containers
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Python application using GitHub Actions
- Deploy your containerized Python application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing Python application.
