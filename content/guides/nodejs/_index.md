The Node.js language-specific guide teaches you how to containerize a Node.js application using Docker. In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- Containerize and run a Node.js application
- Set up a local environment to develop a Node.js application using containers
- Run tests for a Node.js application using containers
- Configure a CI/CD pipeline for a containerized Node.js application using GitHub Actions
- Deploy your containerized Node.js application locally to Kubernetes to test and debug your deployment

Start by containerizing an existing Node.js application.
