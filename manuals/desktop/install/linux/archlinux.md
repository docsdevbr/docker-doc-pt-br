This page contains information on how to install, launch and upgrade Docker Desktop on an Arch-based distribution. Docker has not tested or verified the installation.

## Prerequisites

To install Docker Desktop successfully, you must meet the [general system requirements](index.md#general-system-requirements).

Additionally, for non-Gnome Desktop environments, `gnome-terminal` must be installed:

```console
$ sudo pacman -S gnome-terminal
```

## Install Docker Desktop

1. Install client binaries. Docker does not have an Arch package repository. Binaries not included in the package must be installed manually before installing Docker Desktop.

2. [Install Docker client binary on Linux](../../engine/install/binaries.md#install-daemon-and-client-binaries-on-linux). On Arch-based distributions, users must install the Docker client binary.
   Static binaries for the Docker client are available for Linux (as `docker`).

3. Download the latest Arch package from the [Release notes](../release-notes.md).

4. Install the package:

   ```console
   $ sudo pacman -U ./docker-desktop-<arch>.pkg.tar.zst
   ```

   Don't forget to substitute `<arch>` with the architecture you want.

   By default, Docker Desktop is installed at `/opt/docker-desktop`.
