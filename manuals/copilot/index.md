The Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot integrates Docker's capabilities with
GitHub Copilot, providing assistance with containerizing applications and
generating Docker assets. This extension helps you streamline Docker-related
tasks wherever GitHub Copilot Chat is available.

The key features are:

- Ask questions and receive responses about containerization in any context
  when GitHub Copilot Chat is available, such as on GitHub.com and in Visual Studio Code.
- Automatically generate Dockerfiles, Docker Compose files, and .dockerignore
  files for a project.
- Open pull requests with generated Docker assets directly from the chat
  interface.
- Get summaries of project vulnerabilities from Docker Scout and receive next
  steps via CLI.

## Data Privacy

The Docker agent is trained exclusively on Docker's documentation and tools to
assist with containerization and related tasks. It does not have access to your
project's data outside the context of the questions you ask.

When using the Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot may include
a reference to the currently open file in its request if authorized by the
user. The Docker agent can read the file to provide context-aware responses.

If the agent is requested to check for vulnerabilities or generate
Docker-related assets, it will clone the referenced repository into in-memory
storage to perform the necessary actions.

Source code, questions, and responses are not persistently stored. The Docker
agent processes data only to provide responses and discards it immediately
afterward.

## Supported languages

The Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot supports the following
programming languages:

- Dockerfile
- Go

## Using the extension

The Docker Extension for GitHub Copilot provides a chat interface that you can
use to interact with the Docker agent. You can ask questions and get help
Dockerizing your project.

The Docker agent is trained to understand Docker-related questions, and provide
guidance on Dockerfiles, Docker Compose files, and other Docker assets.

### Editor

To use the extension in your editor or IDE:

1. Open your project in your editor.
2. Open the Copilot chat interface.
3. Interact with the Docker agent using the `/docker` or `@docker`, followed by your question.

### GitHub.com

To use the extension in the GitHub web interface:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and sign in to your account.
2. Go to any repository.
3. Select the Copilot logo in the site menu to open the chat interface.

4. Interact with the Docker agent by tagging `@docker`.

## Example prompts

Here are some examples of the types of questions you can ask the Docker agent:

### Ask general Docker questions

You can ask general question about Docker. For example:

- `@docker what is a Dockerfile`
- `@docker how do I build a Docker image`
- `@docker how do I run a Docker container`

### Ask questions about your project

You can ask questions about your project, such as:

- `@docker what is the best way to Dockerize this project`
- `@docker can you help me find vulnerabilities in my project?`

The Docker agent will analyze your project, generate the necessary files, and,
if applicable, offer to raise a pull request with the necessary Docker assets.

## Performing actions on your behalf

Before the agent performs any actions on your behalf, such as opening a pull
request for you, you're prompted to provide your consent to allow the
operation. You can always roll back or back out of the changes.

In the event that the agent encounters an error, for example during PR
creation, it handles timeouts and lack of responses gracefully.
