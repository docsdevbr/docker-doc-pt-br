title: Callouts
toc_max: 3
---

We support these broad categories of callouts:

- Alerts (Note, Tip, Important, Warning, Caution)
- Version callouts
- Experimental, which use the `{{%/* experimental */%}}` shortcode
- Restricted, which use the `{{%/* restricted */%}}` shortcode

The experimental and restricted shortcodes take a title as an argument. The
title is optional, defaults to "Experimental" or "Restricted" respectively, and
is displayed in the callout.

## Examples

{{< introduced buildx 0.16.0 >}}

> [!NOTE]
>
> Note the way the `get_hit_count` function is written. This basic retry
> loop lets us attempt our request multiple times if the redis service is
> not available. This is useful at startup while the application comes
> online, but also makes our application more resilient if the Redis
> service needs to be restarted anytime during the app's lifetime. In a
> cluster, this also helps handling momentary connection drops between
> nodes.

> [!TIP]
>
> For a smaller base image, use `alpine`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Treat access tokens like your password and keep them secret. Store your
> tokens securely (for example, in a credential manager).

> [!WARNING]
>
> Removing Volumes
>
> By default, named volumes in your compose file are NOT removed when running
> `docker compose down`. If you want to remove the volumes, you will need to add
> the `--volumes` flag.
>
> The Docker Dashboard does not remove volumes when you delete the app stack.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Here be dragons.

For both of the following callouts, consult [the Docker release lifecycle](../../manuals/release-lifecycle.md) for more information on when to use them.
